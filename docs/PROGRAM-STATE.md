# TANK GENERATION PROGRAM — STATE REGISTRY + TAKEOVER HANDBOOK
(written 2026-08-05 at the owner's takeover order; supersedes nothing —
this INDEXES the living law docs, it does not replace them)

## 0. Doc map (where the law lives)
- **docs/BUILD-STANDARD.md** — the LIVING RULEBOOK (owner-ratified build
  laws §A-§I; owner standing directive: keep editing it as lessons land).
- **docs/GEOMETRY-GATE.md** — the measured gate, §10 graduation protocol,
  amendments (three-map retirement, trim-boundary interp clamp).
- **docs/references/tanks/<id>.md** — per-tank PACKETS: round history,
  certified caps/classes, banked orders, freeze entries. The packet is the
  tank's single source of truth.
- **docs/critique/** — independent critic verdicts (shaded-parity-*).
- **docs/ATTRIBUTION.md** — oracle licenses (CC-BY / NC-SA quarantine).
- **docs/geometry-gate/** — tool-written gate rows + ledger.json (NEVER
  hand-edit; stage rows via index-blob surgery, see §6 below).

## 1. Mission + definition of DONE
Every tank in the ~88-row ledger ships as a procedural build in
src/vehicles/profiles/*.js, measured against its community reference GLB
until passing BOTH gates, then graduated per §10. A tank is DONE when:
(1) `node tools/geometry-gate.mjs --ids=<id>` reports every component >=90
(hullCurves, wholeCurves, turretCurves, stations, dims, floaters; certified
oracle-defect caps never cover dims); (2) independent critic >=9.0/10 on
EVERY of 14 views of shaded pairs; (3) turntable eyeball; (4) §10
graduation in the same commit. Program ends when ledger min >=90
fleet-wide, every graduate hash-frozen, no tank registers a reference GLB
at load.

## 2. ABSOLUTE RULES (verbatim-critical)
- THE ONE ABSOLUTE RULE: no assets extracted from commercial games, ever.
- Private local project — never publish, never create accounts.
- docs/geometry-gate/ledger.json is TOOL-WRITTEN only.
- NEVER gate m60a1 / m60a3 / kv2 (kv2's oracle is unrecoverable by design —
  freeze-hash verification only).
- FALSE-0 LAW: never record gate runs against missing/broken references.
- Owner plays on port 5001 — headless tools use their own vite 74xx-77xx.
- /tmp/cot-shots.lock FIFO serializes browser tools. Official tools
  SELF-TICKET — never wrap them in an external lock (deadlocks proven).
  Tickets 15-digit zero-padded. Never clear a live lock; 5-min staleness
  reclaim per the tools' law.
- Agents NEVER commit; the orchestrator verifies rigs+hashes+packets and
  commits precise paths. One family per agent; profile files single-owner.
- ICON TRAP: genIcons rewrites all ~520 icons — use `--tanks <id>` and/or
  stage ONLY the target's 5 icons by exact filename, `git restore
  public/icons/` for the rest. Regenerate from a CLEAN HEAD WORKTREE when
  the live tree carries agent WIP (symlink node_modules into the worktree).
- recovered/* GLBs are NC-SA LOCAL-ONLY QUARANTINE (see ATTRIBUTION.md).
- Env for EVERY node run: `export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"`
- npm test before every landing (166 equipment checks + track-geometry).

## 3. GRADUATE REGISTRY (25 graduates, hash-frozen)
Freeze = deterministic geometry hash via `node tools/tmp-hashgeo.mjs
--ids=...` (camoSeed 4242 pinned build; FNV-1a over position buffers +
world matrices, mesh-order independent). Graduate-change protocol: fix ->
gate hold x2 -> independent re-cert critic >=9.0 on changed views ->
re-freeze NEW hash, all in ONE commit.

Mirror maps (graduates + flip-era tanks measure via these, NOT runtime
registration): tools/procedural-fidelity.html LOCAL_REFERENCE_OVERRIDES,
tools/visual-evaluator-page.html CRITIC_REFERENCE_OVERRIDES (committed),
tools/tmp-tank-critic.html CRITIC_REFERENCE_OVERRIDES (committed at the
takeover sweep decec28). §10 LESSON: mirror
the HELPER-EXPANDED config, never the surface call (the gunNode incident —
userdrops5's `articulated` helper includes `gunNode:'^Gun'`; dropping it
cratered leo2a5 to min 0 at load-prove). Load-prove = `node
tools/tmp-modelsource-dump.mjs` shows the id ABSENT from the glb map +
gate still measures via mirror.

## 4. FLEET STATE at handoff (ledger 2026-08-05, 23/88 pass — revolution
honestly parked at 88.9 pending its retune)
- **Gate-PASS awaiting visual ladder / adjudication**: challenger1 90.2
  (critic floor 7.0, chieftain-exact recipe one round behind), centurion5
  90.7 (floor 7.0, O3 cast-turret round) — uk round-4 agent ON IT.
  m1a2_sepv2 GRADUATED (25th).
- **80-90 band**: m60a2 86.3 (ceiling 87.5 — cert decision pending),
  bradley 84.7, bmp2 84.0 (ceiling), m45_patton 81.2 (stop-rule closed).
- **70-80**: type90 79.0 (climbing, misc r3 agent on it), ariete 78.5
  (ceiling ~82 without cert-class break; wrap-authoring attempt in misc
  r3), m26_pershing 74.8 (dims 91.9 = priced re-anchor debt; patton
  re-anchor agent ON IT), t64bv1 73.4, t90a_vladimir 71.4.
- **Russia tail**: t72b_1987 56.0 CEILING-CERTIFIED (print drum-band cap),
  t90sm 46.9 (loft rework ordered, russia r3 agent on it), t62mv1 47.9
  (decode ordered, same agent), t72bu ~55-70 certified-ceiling — ORACLE
  DECISION PENDING (orchestrator lane).
- **Zero/low rows** (triage lane): recon_tank ruling, fv510/q_heavy/t30
  walls, merkava2b 39.6 / 2d 34.9 / 4 0 / 4b 34.1 (family rebuilds),
  t54 winding repair, m48 pitch, type74+t80bv scaleToOverall ruling.

## 5. IN-FLIGHT AGENTS at handoff (6; on their notifications: verify
rigs+hashes+packets -> pathspec commits -> re-freezes -> spawn follow-ups)
1. DONE+RATIFIED: abrams dual critic (m1a1ha f5c556dc, sepv2 §10 run).
2. DONE+RATIFIED: revolution re-cert (1993cfb1); retune round SPAWNED
   (hull 88.9 -> 90+ + P-1 fore-ring tells + P-2).
3. **misc r3**: type90 ladder + ariete wrap-break attempt.
4. **russia tail-3**: t62mv1 decode + t90sm §B1 loft rework.
5. **patton re-anchor**: m26 post-warp re-anchor from the WARPED extract
   (dims 91.9 -> 100 via proc M2 band lift to the 3.08 spec).
6. **uk round-4**: challenger1 + centurion5 visual ladders toward
   adjudication (26th/27th candidates). MUST hold centurion3 bf0a45e8.

## 6. ORCHESTRATOR MECHANICS (how landings actually work)
- **Pathspec/hunk-split commits**: the owner's parallel session stages
  deletions and edits shared files — check `git diff --cached --name-only`
  before every commit; never `git commit -a`. For tool-written JSON
  (ledger) stage surgical row updates WITHOUT touching the worktree file:
  build content = HEAD + target rows, then `git hash-object -w` +
  `git update-index --cacheinfo 100644,<blob>,<path>` (script:
  scratchpad stage-ledger-rows.py pattern — HEAD rows + worktree rows for
  the named ids + recomputed passed/total).
- **Split-staging a shared code file** (e.g. repair_oracles.py holding two
  batches for different landings): build the staged variant from the
  worktree by cutting the held-back block, hash-object + cacheinfo, keep
  the worktree intact.
- **Cross-file rider grep at every landing**: profile diffs referencing
  symbols (BUCKET_DEF entries, cfg.*/S.* params) must resolve in COMMITTED
  files — grep before committing or HEAD lands mid-state.
- **Oracle repairs (warp law v2, §E)**: fresh .bak from committed HEAD
  bytes; PRE-FLIGHT: run the existing chain and prove it reproduces
  committed bytes BEFORE extending; batches before `if __name__`;
  byte-idempotent shasum x2; census expect guards; gate-in-loop vs stable
  baseline; demotion notes when a recipe supersedes (archive old bak as
  *.pre-batchNN-history). Spec-mirror true-ups (vertex-extract.mjs
  pubDims) land in the SAME batch as their userdrops spec edit.
- **Agent brief boilerplate** (every spawn): NEVER commit; single-owner
  file; env line; own vite 74xx-77xx; FIFO hard rules; NEVER stop to wait
  on watchers (stopping ends the run — run chains sequentially
  in-process); graduate hashes to hold; false-0; read BUILD-STANDARD
  first; §F.4 report format; packets WRITTEN before reporting.
- **Infrastructure deaths**: SendMessage-resume first (context intact);
  respawn fresh only if the transcript is unrecoverable. Waiter-stalls
  (agent stops "to wait") get a finalize nudge via SendMessage.

## 7. MY-LANE QUEUE (orchestrator work, ripeness order at handoff)
1. Land the six in-flight agents' results (per §5 protocols).
2. t72bu oracle decision (certified-ceiling ~55-70; packet has the
   evidence; options: warp batch vs ceiling-cert vs re-source).
3. m60a2 cert decision (86.3 vs ceiling 87.5).
4. Fleet flip wave 2 (donor/0-row ids as builds land) + full fleet gate
   sweep (post-amendment ledger refresh; expect frozen-row drift-up
   refreshes, no re-cert needed per the amendment).
5. Band-solver front mirror for type90 (flagged orchestrator-lane by misc
   r2: the 3.68 col, ~0.28x2).
6. Smaller rulings: t54 winding repair (scout-gen2-t54.md), m48 pitch +
   _region_pitch, scaleToOverall ruling (type74+t80bv), workorder
   shared-box promote, mask-island certs, contact-alias, tejas drift 89.4,
   recon_tank ruling, fv510/q_heavy/t30 walls, RIM-FLOOR fleet lighting
   term, padHug frozen-centurion coupling, mg FITTINGS migrations (§I),
   shoe-envelope audit extension.

## 8. OWNER DIRECTIVE LOG (this program's history; all codified as law)
1. §B5 turret furniture parenting (sepv3/merkavas/t72b3m rear-turret kit
   must rotate) — LAW + fleet audit tool; DONE for named tanks.
2. §B6 track silhouette \\________/ (chieftain front) — LAW; DONE.
3. §B1 Abrams sloped turret fronts (with photo) — LAW; DONE.
4. LIVING RULEBOOK: continuously edit the generating rules — ONGOING.
5. AFV love (bradley/bmp2) + owner-downloaded m2_bradley_ifv.glb
   (CC-BY-4.0, ATTRIBUTION.md) — oracle landed; bands 84.7/84.0.
6. CUSTOM tab completeness (t80, type10, type99a, leo1a5, t14, t72b3,
   challenger2, type74, pt-91, k2, chieftain mk10, sepv3-from-abrams) —
   DONE (roster 70).
7. t84 turret seat (batch-40 compound warp) — DONE, graduated.
8. c1 ariete broken turret — rebuilt; ladder ongoing (78.5).
9. kf51 turret front — DONE, graduated 3ae9b70c.
10. §B1 NO-STAIRCASES (screenshot) — LAW.
11. §B1 SLOPE-MOTIVATES-THE-MASS — LAW.
12. §B3 NO-MYSTERY-BOXES (merkavas/t-xx/sepv3, especially guns) — LAW;
    merkava pod-tells re-certed + re-frozen; sepv2 swept (candidate 25).
13. m1a1ha rear tracks/gaps (screenshot) — fixed, pending re-cert critic.
14. leo2_revolution fused turret (screenshot) — coupled de-fusion LANDED
    c9ddba0 (honest 88.9; retune round owed).
15. Scale: "many more agents open building tanks" — 6 in flight at
    handoff; keep respawning freed family lanes on every landing.
16. Takeover order (2026-08-05): this document + full commit/push.

## 9. INCIDENT LESSONS (codified; the mechanism lives in the named law)
- gunNode/helper-expansion (§10 lesson, GEOMETRY-GATE.md + §3 above).
- t84 double-warp: python asserts on REPAIRS[id] must target the LAST
  definition site (rindex) — duplicate keys ran a stale batch and
  double-warped; restore from fresh .bak = committed bytes.
- Assert-after-append bug: landing scripts must assert against the FILE,
  not the in-memory copy they just appended to.
- Stale staged deletions (owner's parallel session) swept into commits
  twice — hence the §6 pathspec/cacheinfo discipline, always.
- genIcons on a live tree with agent WIP times out / bakes WIP geometry —
  clean HEAD worktree + symlinked node_modules + --tanks filter.
- zsh word-splitting: `for t in $VAR` treats the string as one word — use
  `${=VAR}`.
- FIFO: foreign plain-FILE lock wedged the dir-lock FIFO — all lock tools
  patched (rmdir -> ENOTDIR -> unlink). Self-locking tools deadlock inside
  external wrappers (two incidents). 16-digit tickets queue-jump the
  15-digit sort. Under fleet load, official runs die at the 30-min queue
  timeout — retry honestly; one-ticket batch drivers for render batches.
- Vite serves LIVE bytes at navigation time — a queued driver renders the
  tree as of lock-acquisition; treat in-flight runs as measuring the
  current tree.
- Browser-pane screenshots read black on this box — verify visuals via
  repo puppeteer tools (tools/tmp-*.mjs), never pane screenshots.
- Cross-critic calibration: the ratified chieftain5 anchor governs
  severity disputes; adjudicate with measurements, not vibes.
- Agents stopping to "wait on watchers/monitors" end their own runs — the
  brief boilerplate forbids it; nudge stalled agents to run chains
  sequentially in-process.
- Critic top-pair orientation: bow = image bottom (gun-overhang check
  before calling turret-front reads).
- ORACLE-REGISTRATION-PINNED class: when the REF keeps furniture
  hull-side, the fix is coupled (followers extension in the three maps +
  proc re-parent + full re-gate in ONE landing).
- Camo-bucket moves reseed bakeDirt mottle (LOCAL frame) — pixel-diff
  unreachable; full critic re-cert required.

## 10. PERF/CERT SIDE-LANE (background)
tools/quietcert.mjs waits for a genuinely quiet machine to certify the
perf budget (docs/cert-r6-* artifacts; contended attempts REFUSED by
design). Under constant fleet load it may never find a window — that is
honest; do not relax its stamps. Re-launch overnight when agent load
drops: `nohup node tools/quietcert.mjs >> docs/quietcert-r6.log 2>&1 &`
